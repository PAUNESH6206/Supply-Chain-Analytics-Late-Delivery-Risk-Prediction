Supply Chain Analytics: Late Delivery Risk Prediction & Insights

Objective

This project analyzes supply chain data to predict late delivery risks and generate actionable insights. By optimizing logistics, it aims to improve customer satisfaction and maximize profitability.

Scope

Data Analysis: Compare actual vs. scheduled shipping times, evaluate delivery risks, and analyze sales trends.

Predictive Modeling: Develop a machine learning model to predict Late_delivery_risk based on factors such as shipping mode and regional data.

Dashboard: Build an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize key metrics, including delivery performance, profit margins, and delay patterns.


Dataset

The dataset consists of 53 columns, including:

Days for shipping (real), Late_delivery_risk, Sales per customer, Shipping Mode, Latitude, Longitude, etc.


Source: Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paunesh/supply-chain-analytics/data).


Tools & Technologies

Python: Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib/Seaborn for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and modeling.

Power BI: Dashboard creation for stakeholder reporting and visualization.

GitHub: Version control and collaboration.


Key Outcomes

1. 15% of orders were identified as high-risk for late delivery, with certain regions being more affected.


2. Expedited shipping reduced delays by 20% compared to standard shipping methods.


3. The predictive model achieved 85% accuracy in forecasting late deliveries.

Requirement Questions

1. Delivery Performance

What percentage of orders experience late deliveries, and which regions or markets are most affected?

How does Shipping Mode (e.g., expedited vs. standard) impact Late_delivery_risk and profitability?

Is there a correlation between Days for shipment (scheduled) and actual delivery delays?


2. Sales & Profitability

Which product categories yield the highest Benefit per order and Order Profit Per Order?

Does increasing the Order Item Discount Rate lead to a higher Order Item Quantity, but at the cost of reduced profit?

Are there seasonal trends in sales, such as increased demand during holidays?


3. Customer Behavior

How does Customer Segment (e.g., corporate vs. individual) influence purchasing patterns?

Which geographic regions (Order Country/Market) contribute the most to overall sales?


4. Operational Efficiency

Can we predict Late_delivery_risk using features such as delay_duration and Shipping Mode?

What is the average delay duration per region, and how can logistics be optimized to reduce delays?
